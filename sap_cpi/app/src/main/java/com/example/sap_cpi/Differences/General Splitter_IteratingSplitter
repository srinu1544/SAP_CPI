General Splitter:
---------------
Splits a composite message into individual messages, but retains the enveloping elements (like the root node)
 in each of the split messages .
Each split message contains the original message's structure, including the surrounding tags or elements .
Useful when the context of the enveloping elements is important for subsequent processing .

Iterating Splitter:
-------------------
Splits a composite message into individual messages, but discards the enveloping elements .
Each split message contains only the content of the split entity, without the surrounding tags or elements .
Useful when the context of the enveloping elements is not needed for subsequent processing, and you want to focus on the individual elements themselves .

In essence:
General Splitter: "Splits the message and keeps the wrapper".
Iterating Splitter: "Splits the message and discards the wrapper".
