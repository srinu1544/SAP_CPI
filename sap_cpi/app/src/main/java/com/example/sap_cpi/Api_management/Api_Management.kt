/* API

Reference for free apis
TODO - https://api.sap.com/

An api (application programming interface) is a set of rules and specifications that allows different software
applications to communicate and interact with each other , enabling data exchange and functionality sharing.

->  it is coming under the capability

Types of apis -
-> public apis :
   Public APIs, also known as Open APIs, are available to any developer or organization without restrictions.
    These APIs are designed to be used by third-party developers to integrate with external applications.
    ->  Openly accessible with minimal restrictions.
    Ex : Google Maps API – Allows developers to embed maps and navigation features into applications.


-> partner apis :
   Partner APIs are shared with specific business partners rather than being open to the public.
   These APIs require special permissions and agreements between companies.
   -> Restricted access, available only to authorized business partners.
   Ex : Amazon Selling Partner API – Used by third-party sellers to manage inventory, orders, and pricing


-> internal or private api :

   Internal APIs, also known as Private APIs, are used within an organization to connect different services,
    applications, or teams. These APIs are not exposed to the public and are strictly for internal use.
    -> Restricted to internal developers and teams
    Ex : Banking Internal APIs – Used by internal teams to manage transactions, account information, and fraud detection.

-> composite api :
   --------------
   Composite APIs allow developers to combine multiple API calls into a single request. Instead of making multiple separate requests
   to different services, a single API call triggers multiple processes at once.
   -> Improves efficiency by reducing the number of API calls.
   Ex : E-commerce Checkout API – A single API call can:
        Validate user payment details.
        Check stock availability.
        Place an order.
        Send a confirmation email.

API protocols in sap cpi :
-> REST
-> SOAP
-> ODATA

 important in apis :
 -> api provider - it is used to abstract or used to connecting the backend system or it is call target system.
 -> api proxy  - it is actual api used to using to connect to target system or which will be using to connect to
                 the target system or to design our api where we design all those things.
                 -> their can be multiple proxys for api providers
                 ->  you can combine all the api proxies to the api product
 -> api product
