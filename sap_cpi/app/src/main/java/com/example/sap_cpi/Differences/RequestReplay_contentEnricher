What is the difference between Request Replay and content Enricher :

Request Reply:
--------------
-> It sends the data to the receiver system and gets the data back from the receiver system, like a synchronous call.
-> The response coming from the receiver system replaces the previous payload from the step before the Request Reply,
   meaning the new data overwrites the old data.
-> Commonly used when a confirmation, validation, or additional information is required from the receiver system.

Content Enricher:
-----------------
->  we can connect content enricher from only receiver.
-> It sends the data to an external system to fetch additional information without replacing the original payload.
-> The response from the external system is merged with the original payload instead of overwriting it.
-> Useful when the existing data is incomplete, and additional data is required to enrich it for further processing.
-> Content enrichment can be done using XPath, JSONPath, or Groovy scripting for data merging.
-> Mainly used in asynchronous flows where enrichment is necessary before further processing.
