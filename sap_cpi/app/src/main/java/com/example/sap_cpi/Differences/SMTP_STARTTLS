What is the different between SMTP and STARTTLS ?

 Port 587 (SMTP with STARTTLS)
 -----------------------------
Used for email submission from client to server.
Starts as a plain text connection and upgrades to TLS using STARTTLS.
Uses SMTP protocol with added encryption.
Officially assigned for email submission by IANA.
Supports both encrypted and unencrypted communication.
Recommended for modern email clients like Gmail and Outlook.
Provides strong security with TLS after the handshake.
Compliant with RFC 6409 as the preferred standard.

Port 465 (SMTPS - SMTP with Implicit TLS)
------------------------------------------
Used for email submission with immediate encryption using TLS.
Connection is encrypted from the start (Implicit TLS).
Uses the SMTPS protocol, a legacy version of secure SMTP.
Historically assigned for SMTPS but is now deprecated.
Only supports encrypted communication.
Sometimes used by legacy systems or outdated email clients.
Provides strong encryption with fewer risks but lacks flexibility.
Deprecated by RFC 8314, though still used in specific cases.
