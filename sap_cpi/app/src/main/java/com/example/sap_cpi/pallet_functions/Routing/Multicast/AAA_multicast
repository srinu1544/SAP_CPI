multicast
----------

-> This is a message routing step that sends a copy of the same messaged to the multiple routes.
-> you can use multicast in scenarios where you need to distribute or broadcast the same message to
   different systems or services
-> Without Multicast, you needed multiple integration processes to perform this task.

we have two types in multicast :
--------------------------------
-> parallel multicast
-> sequential  multicast
