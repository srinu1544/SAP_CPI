multicast
----------
-> This is a message routing step that sends a copy of the same messaged to the multiple routes.
-> you can use multicast in scenarios where you need to distribute or broadcast the same message to
   different systems or services
-> Without Multicast, you needed multiple integration processes to perform this task.

we have two types in multicast :
--------------------------------
-> parallel multicast
-> sequential  multicast

parallel multicast :
--------------------
This is a message routing step that sends a copy of the same message to multiple routes at the same time.
you can use parallel multicast in scenarios where you need to perform multiple operations on the same message in parallel or
where the order of execution in not important.


sequential multicast :
---------------------
This is a message routing step that sends a copy of the same message to multiple routes in a specific order.
you can use parallel multicast in scenarios where you need to perform multiple operations on the same message in parallel or
where the order of execution in important. it is used when one path dependent on another path
-> Only after the first path is finished (successfully or with an error), the second branch starts.*/
