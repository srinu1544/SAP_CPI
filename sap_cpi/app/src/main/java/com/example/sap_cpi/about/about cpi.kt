Yes, it is technically possible to handle integration directly within the connected systems, but there are several
reasons why SAP CPI (Cloud Platform Integration) is preferred over a system-to-system approach:

1. Complexity of Direct Integrations
If every system integrates directly with others, you create point-to-point (P2P) connections.
As the number of systems increases, the complexity grows exponentially.
CPI provides a centralized hub that simplifies integration.

2. Data Transformation is Not Always Feasible in Source/Target Systems
Many systems are not designed to handle complex transformations (e.g., converting XML to JSON, modifying payload
 structure, or enriching data).
CPI allows you to do all these without modifying the source/target applications.

3. Protocol & Technology Differences
Different systems may use different communication protocols (REST, SOAP, IDocs, SFTP, JMS, etc.).
Some older systems may not support modern API-based communication.
CPI bridges these differences without requiring changes in each system.

4. Maintenance & Scalability
If every system has custom-built integrations, maintaining them becomes difficult when updates or changes are needed.
CPI provides a centralized platform where integrations can be managed, monitored, and updated easily.

5. Security & Compliance
Direct integrations often require opening firewalls, VPNs, or exposing APIs, which can create security risks.
CPI ensures secure communication with encryption, authentication, and SAPâ€™s compliance standards.

6. Monitoring & Error Handling
In a direct integration, debugging issues can be hard because logs are scattered across different systems.
CPI provides a centralized dashboard for monitoring and error handling, making troubleshooting much easier.

7. SAP-Optimized Integration
If you are integrating SAP and non-SAP systems, CPI provides pre-built connectors and best practices.
It reduces custom development effort and ensures better compatibility with SAP landscapes.
Conclusion: Why Not Just Use Existing Systems?
âœ… While itâ€™s possible to convert or modify systems to handle integration, itâ€™s not always practical because of
 complexity, security risks, maintenance challenges, and lack of standardization.
âœ… SAP CPI provides a scalable, secure, and efficient way to integrate systems while reducing custom development effort.
