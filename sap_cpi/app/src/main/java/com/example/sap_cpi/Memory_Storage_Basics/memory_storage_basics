Understanding memory and storage sizes is essential in software development,
especially when dealing with system performance, file storage, and data processing. Here's a quick breakdown:

Basic Memory Units
1 Bit (b) = Smallest unit of data (0 or 1).
1 Byte (B) = 8 Bits (Stores a single character like ‚ÄòA‚Äô or ‚Äò1‚Äô).
1 Kilobyte (KB) = 1024 Bytes (Used for small text files).
1 Megabyte (MB) = 1024 KB (Used for images, documents).
1 Gigabyte (GB) = 1024 MB (Used for applications, videos).
1 Terabyte (TB) = 1024 GB (Used for large data storage, databases).
1 Petabyte (PB) = 1024 TB (Used for massive cloud storage, data centers).
1 Exabyte (EB) = 1024 PB (Used in big data and global storage).
1 Zettabyte (ZB) = 1024 Exabytes (EB) (Used for global internet traffic, large-scale cloud storage, and scientific data processing).
1 Yottabyte (YB) = 1024 Zettabytes (ZB) (Potentially used for storing all digital data ever created, advanced AI models, and interplanetary data storage).

Memory vs. Storage
Memory (RAM) ‚Äì Temporary, volatile, fast, used for active processes. Example: 8GB RAM in a laptop.
Storage (HDD/SSD) ‚Äì Permanent, non-volatile, slower than RAM. Example: 512GB SSD for storing files.

Speed Measurement (Processing & Transfer Rates)

Hertz (Hz) ‚Äì CPU speed, e.g., 3.2 GHz = 3.2 billion cycles per second.
Mbps (Megabits per second) ‚Äì Network speed (e.g., 100 Mbps internet speed).
MBps (Megabytes per second) ‚Äì File transfer speed (e.g., SSD: 500 MBps read speed).

3. Types of Memory in Software
RAM (Random Access Memory) ‚Äì Temporary memory for running applications.
ROM (Read-Only Memory) ‚Äì Stores firmware and cannot be modified easily.
Cache Memory ‚Äì Fastest memory, stores frequently accessed data.
Virtual Memory ‚Äì Part of storage (HDD/SSD) used when RAM is full.
Swap Memory (Linux) ‚Äì Dedicated disk space for virtual memory (like page file in Windows).
Flash Memory ‚Äì Used in USB drives, SSDs, memory cards (Non-volatile storage).


4. Speed Measurements in Computing
Processing Speeds (CPU Performance)
Hertz (Hz) ‚Äì CPU speed, measures instructions per second.
1 GHz = 1 billion cycles per second.
Example: A 3.5 GHz processor can execute 3.5 billion cycles per second.
Data Transfer Speeds
bps (Bits per second) ‚Äì Used for internet speed (e.g., 100 Mbps broadband).
Bps (Bytes per second) ‚Äì Used for file transfer (e.g., SSD: 500 MBps read speed).
Latency (ms - milliseconds) ‚Äì Time delay in data transfer (lower is better).
üí° Important Note:

Mbps = Megabits per second (Internet speed).
MBps = Megabytes per second (File transfer speed).
1 MBps = 8 Mbps (Because 1 Byte = 8 Bits).

5. Memory Hierarchy (Fastest to Slowest)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Registers (Inside CPU, measured in nanoseconds) ‚Äì Used for immediate processing.
2Ô∏è‚É£ L1, L2, L3 Cache (Closer to CPU, used for frequently accessed data).
3Ô∏è‚É£ RAM (Main Memory) ‚Äì Holds active applications.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Memory (Slower, part of SSD/HDD used as extra RAM).
5Ô∏è‚É£ Storage (HDD/SSD/NVMe) ‚Äì Used for files, OS, software storage.
6Ô∏è‚É£ External Storage (Cloud, USB, HDD) ‚Äì Slowest but used for backup.
