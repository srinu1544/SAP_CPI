1xx â€“ Informational Responses

These codes indicate that the request is being processed but is not yet completed.
100 Continue â€“ The server received the initial request and asks the client to continue.
102 Processing â€“ The server has received the request and is still processing it.
âœ… Useful in long-running API requests where the server acknowledges but takes time to respond.

2xx â€“ Success
--------------
These indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and processed.
200 OK â€“ The request was successful, and the response contains the requested data.
201 Created â€“ A new resource was successfully created.
202 Accepted â€“ The request has been accepted for processing but is not yet completed.
âœ… Common in asynchronous APIs (e.g., sending messages to a queue in SAP CPI).
204 No Content â€“ The request was successful, but no response body is returned (useful in REST services when no data needs to be returned).
206 Partial Content â€“ Only part of the requested resource is returned.
âœ… Happens when downloading large files in chunks (e.g., paginated API responses).

3xx â€“ Redirection
-----------------
These codes tell the client that further action is required to complete the request.
301 Moved Permanently â€“ The requested resource has a new URL permanently.
302 Found â€“ The requested resource is temporarily available at a different URL.
307 Temporary Redirect â€“ Used in OAuth token-based authentication, where authentication servers redirect requests.
308 Permanent Redirect â€“ Similar to 301, but strictly enforces the HTTP method.
âœ… Can occur in OAuth 2.0 authentication, where endpoints move permanently.

4xx â€“ Client Errors
-------------------
These indicate that the request has an error, usually due to invalid input from the client.

400 Bad Request â€“ The request is malformed or has missing parameters.
âœ… Common in SAP CPI when calling APIs with incorrect headers or payloads.

401 Unauthorized â€“ Authentication credentials are missing or incorrect.
âœ… Occurs if SAP CPI does not provide correct OAuth tokens or API keys.

403 Forbidden â€“ The user is authenticated but does not have permission to access the resource.
âœ… Occurs in SAP CPI when an API restricts access based on roles or IP whitelisting.

404 Not Found â€“ The requested resource does not exist.
âœ… Occurs if an API endpoint is incorrect, deprecated, or unavailable.

405 Method Not Allowed â€“ The HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) is not supported by the API.
âœ… Occurs in SAP CPI when using an incorrect HTTP method in a Request-Reply step.

406 Not Acceptable â€“ The server cannot provide the response in the requested format.
âœ… Happens if SAP CPI requests XML but the API only supports JSON.

409 Conflict â€“ The request conflicts with the current state of the resource.
âœ… Occurs when trying to update a resource that has already been modified (e.g., optimistic locking in APIs).

408 Request Timeout â€“ The client took too long to send the request.
âœ… Can happen if an API takes too long to respond, causing SAP CPI to timeout.

410 Gone â€“ The resource was available before but no longer exists.
âœ… Indicates deprecated API endpoints in SAP CPI integrations.

417 Expectation Failed â€“ The server cannot meet the expectations of the request.
âœ… Can occur when a client sends an Expect header in an API request, but the server doesnâ€™t support it.

415 Unsupported Media Type â€“ The server does not support the format of the request (e.g., sending XML when JSON is expected).
âœ… Common in SAP CPI when integrating with APIs that require specific content types.

418 I'm a Teapot â˜• â€“ Originally an April Foolâ€™s joke, but some APIs return it for blocked requests.
âœ… Rare, but fun to know! ðŸ˜†

422 Unprocessable Entity â€“ The request is well-formed but contains invalid data.
âœ… Happens in APIs when data validation fails (e.g., missing required fields).

428 Precondition Required â€“ The server requires preconditions (e.g., If-Match header).
âœ… Can occur in ETag-based updates to prevent overwriting changes.

429 Too Many Requests â€“ The API has rate limits and has blocked further requests.
âœ… Occurs in SAP CPI when making frequent API calls beyond allowed limits (e.g., SAP Ariba or SAP SuccessFactors APIs).

5xx â€“ Server Errors
-------------------

500 Internal Server Error â€“ A generic error message when the backend fails.
âœ… Occurs when SAP S/4HANA, Ariba, or any backend system has internal failures.

502 Bad Gateway â€“ The API gateway or middleware (like SAP API Management) received an invalid response.
âœ… Occurs when SAP CPI interacts with an intermediary service that fails.

503 Service Unavailable â€“ The server is down or overloaded.
âœ… Occurs when SAP backend systems (S/4HANA, Ariba) are undergoing maintenance or facing heavy traffic.

504 Gateway Timeout â€“ The upstream server took too long to respond.
âœ… Common when SAP CPI connects to slow APIs, causing timeout errors.

507 Insufficient Storage â€“ The server cannot store the requested resource.
âœ… Can happen in file-based integrations where storage limits are exceeded.

511 Network Authentication Required â€“ The client must authenticate with the network.
âœ… Rare, but can appear if SAP CPI is behind a proxy that requires authentication.

ðŸ“Œ Special or Uncommon HTTP Status Codes
418 I'm a teapot â€“ An April Fool's joke from the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP).
451 Unavailable for Legal Reasons â€“ Used when access to a resource is restricted due to legal reasons (e.g., government censorship).
511 Network Authentication Required â€“ Indicates that network access requires authentication (e.g., login on public WiFi).
